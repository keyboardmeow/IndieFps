/*
Ultimate FPS Integration

This folder contains Ultimate FPS (UFPS) integration files. The sub-folders are:

- Scripts: Integration scripts to coordinate control and data exchange between UFPS and the Dialogue System.
- Example: Example scene demonstrating the Dialogue System with UFPS.

Historical note: Prior to version 1.5.8, the Example folder was named Deep Integration Example, and there 
was a Shallow Integration Example. The examples have been streamlined into one scene.
